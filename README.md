## What is this ?

A gamepad to control the crazy game [twitchplayspokemon](http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon) without having to type.

## How to use it ?

One does simply open its javascript console (ctrl+maj+i on chrome) and paste this :

> $.getScript("https://raw.github.com/altitude-labs/gamepad-twitchplayspokemon/master/gamepad.js")

And it's done ! You can now enjoy this experiment without melting your fingers.
